**1. Motivation**

One of the great founding father Thomas Jefferson once said, "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants" in his [letter](//www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/jefffed.html#105) to William Smith. The underlying meaning of his word cannot be understood without the context of historical background: oppression of British government and the struggle to earn independency. However, from what is being written, it also implies that the prosperity of one country accompanies sacrifices. This study examines whether the sacrifices arise from civil war can explain the changes of the level of democracy and liberty of one country.

**2. Literature Review**

In political science field, more narrowly in peace studies, the study on correlational relationship between institutional democracy can lead to world peace. One study from [Hegre et al. (2001)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3117627?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) suggested that intermediate regimes are prone to civil war, destabilizing political climate. The idea of Hegre et al. is often referred as 'Inverted U-Shape' to illustrate that semi-democracies (similar to intermediate regimes) experience more civil violence than autocracies and democracies ([Knutsen & Nyg√•rd, 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12168))
