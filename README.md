**1. Motivation**

One of the great founding fathers Thomas Jefferson once said, "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants" in his [letter](//www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/jefffed.html#105) to William Smith. The underlying meaning of his word cannot be understood without the context of historical background: oppression of British government and the struggle to earn independency. However, from what is being written, it also implies that the prosperity of one country accompanies sacrifices. This study examines whether the sacrifices arise from civil war can explain the changes of the level of democracy and liberty of one country.

**2. Literature Review**

In political science field, more narrowly in peace studies, the study on correlational relationship between institutional democracy can lead to world peace. One study from [Hegre et al. (2001)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3117627?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) suggested that intermediate regimes are prone to civil war, destabilizing political climate. The idea of Hegre et al. is often referred as 'Inverted U-Shape' to illustrate that semi-democracies (similar to intermediate regimes) experience more civil violence than autocracies and democracies ([Knutsen & Nyg√•rd, 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12168))

\<Figure 1: Inverted U-shape>

As \<Figure 1> from [Krishnarajan et al. (2016)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2822231) illustrates, where the democracy index is around 5 has the highest probability of starting the civil war. Even though prior research suggests that there is a relationship between the level of democracy and the likelihood of civil violence, their approach is different from this study's approach. While prior research explains the likelihood of civil violence with the level of democracy, this study explains how the level of democracy increased or decreased by fatalities.

**3. Hypotheses**

* H1. The changes of democracy score and the liberty score is not identical

* H2a. There is no relationship between the democracy score and the bloodshed due to civil war

* H2b. There is no relationship between the liberty score and the blood shed due to civil war

Listed above are the hypotheses that this study aims to answer. First hypothesis approaches to answer whether the democracy and liberty score of one country changes in the same way. This hypothesis will be helpful to demonstrate whether the country with free market also has democractic political system, although this is often thought to be true as history has seen. Building on the hypothesis 1, each of H2a and H2b centers around answering the question of correlational relationship between the either democracy or liberty score and fatalities of the civil war. This study operationalize the blood of patriots and tyrants as fatalities.

**4. Datasets**

ICPSR is an institutional repository where the researchers who are affiliated with ICPSR publicize the dataset they used for the study for the sake of reproducibility. However, since ICPSR has rules that the data has to be accessed through ICPSR, this github repository does not uploaded the datasets being used. This study takes two datasets for [civil war data](https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR09905.v1) and [democracy data](https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR20440.v1). Anyone who are interested in replicating this study can access to the data by clicking it.

**5. Design Reasoning**

Fatalities (independent var) are normalized by total population at the moment of civil war. As changes in democracy score (dependent var) right after the end of the war is not sufficient to show changes in democracy score. Perhaps civil war has created the political instability and resulted in decreased in democracy level and liberty level. Therefore, this study measures 5 years, 10 years, and 20 years after the end of the war to consider the reconstruction period. In summary, independent variables are changes in democracy and liberty score with normalized fatalities as dependent variable. The level of analysis is civil war, not the country, meaning each data point represents the civil war. In addition, data with NAs in democracy, libery, and population score was removed.

**6. Preliminary Results of H1** 

|   Country   | Total Fatalities |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|
|    CHINA    |     3,497,525    |
| AFGHANISTAN |     1,064,000    |
|   NIGERIA   |     1,006,000    |
|     ...     |        ...       |
|   HONDURAS  |       1,000      |
|   SARDINIA  |       1,000      |
|  TAJIKISTAN |       1,000      |

\<Table 1: Total fatalities by country>

204 civil wars had occurred during 1816 - 1992 in 66 countries (SARDINIA has been removed from further analysis because it was not included in the democracy data). To answer hypothesis 1, this study conducted t-test in [scipy library](https://www.scipy.org/docs.html). Among 65 countries, 62 countries had p-value less than 0.05. This indicates in most countries, democracy score and liberty score changes in the same direction. For example, if democracy score decreased, then liberty score also decreased.
